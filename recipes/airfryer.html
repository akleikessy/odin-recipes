    <p>Potato latkes are usually fried, on top of the stove, but the air fryers on the market right now are a great way to prepare this popular dish. This method yields a crispy latke that can be an appetizer or a dinner side. If you have an oil sprayer, you can use your oil of choice. I used purchased avocado oil spray, to give that beautiful brown color. Serve with sour cream or applesauce, if desired. Refrigerate any leftovers in an airtight container, up to 5 days.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package frozen shredded hash brown potatoes, thawed</li>
        <li>Â½ cup shredded onion</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>kosher salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons matzo meal</li>
        <li>avocado oil cooking spray</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an air fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) according to manufacturer's instructions. Lay out a sheet of parchment or waxed paper.</li>
        <li>Place thawed potatoes and shredded onion on several layers of paper towels. Cover with more paper towels and press to squeeze out most of the liquid.</li>
        <li>Whisk together egg, salt, and pepper in a large bowl. Stir in potatoes and onion with a fork. Sprinkle matzo meal on top and stir until ingredients are evenly distributed. Use your hands to form mixture into ten 3- to 4-inch wide patties. Place patties on the parchment or waxed paper.</li>
        <li>Spray the air fryer basket with cooking spray. Carefully place half of the patties in the basket and spray generously with cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Air-fry until crispy and dark golden brown on the outside, 10 to 12 minutes. (Check for doneness at 8 minutes if you prefer a softer latke.) Remove latkes to a plate. Repeat with remaining patties, spraying them with cooking spray before cooking.</li>
    </ol>
